## Narrative

Broad survey of open-source **sports betting, DFS, arbitrage, and Polymarket** repos. Gambling-wiki extracts **retail-relevant** layers; bot adoption verdicts stay on `@osint-wiki`.

### Layer map (retail focus)

| Layer | Examples | Gambling-wiki use |
|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Data / stats | `roclark/sportsipy`, `bttmly/nba` | Reference for building projections |
| **Classical ML / DFS** | `kyleskom/NBA-Machine-Learning-Sports-Betting`, **`pydfs-lineup-optimizer`** | DFS + model research — `@entities/tools/pydfs-lineup-optimizer.md` |
| **Fiat sharp/soft arb** | `Live-Sports-Arbitrage-Bet-Finder`, `pretrehr/Sports-betting` | Alert-only pattern — `@concepts/sharp-vs-soft-books.md` |
| Copy-trading PM bots | Multiple GitHub forks | **NO-GO retail** — `@concepts/pm-copy-trading-retail-risks.md` |
| DRL / quant | `machine-learning-for-trading` | Out of scope unless quant ingest |

### Sharp vs soft (fiat)

Report: **Pinnacle** as sharp reference, **Bwin/PMU** as soft execution — latency arb when soft book lags sharp move. Open-source finders are **alert-only**; autonomous arb hits ToS, limits, and stale-line risk [TENTATIVE].

### Copy-trading caution [CONFIRMED report + YouTube experiments]

Whale-copy bots cascade on large wallet trades — hundreds of followers consume liquidity in seconds, amplifying slippage. Retail should assume **adverse selection** when copying public alerts (Odds Jam, PolySniper promos).

### Security hygiene (any self-hosted bot)

Accidental `.env` commits with wallet private keys remain the most common catastrophic loss in open-source PM repos — never run unaudited fork with real keys.

### Phase-0 queue (gambling-wiki)

| Tool/repo | Verdict | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| `pydfs-lineup-optimizer` | **CONDITIONAL-GO** | Verify license + NFL/NBA slate fit before install |
| Fiat arb finders | **Reference only** | Manual confirmation required |
| Copy-trading bots | **NO-GO** | Strategy + flow toxicity |
| Closed SaaS (MomentumOdds, Odds Jam) | **Reference** | Commercial TOS + track record |
