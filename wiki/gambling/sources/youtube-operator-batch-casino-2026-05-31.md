| **Retrieved** | 2026-05-31 |
| **Archive** | `raw-sources/youtube-{id}.en.vtt` — 25 VTTs (routed from `.tmp-yt-ingest-3` 2026-06-06); 2 metadata-only (no EN subs) |
| **Read status** | deep-read |

**Credibility:** Mix of reputable training channels (Blackjack Apprenticeship, American Casino Guide) and entertainment/promo (Vegas Matt slots, Mikki Mase Short). Slot "systems" and progressive betting marked `[RETRACTED]`.

### Cross-cutting themes

**Blackjack (Blackjack Apprenticeship cluster)**
- **Basic strategy** ≈ **0.5%** house edge vs **1–2%** for average player [Source: HeVclniKpHs]
- Charts are **rule-dependent** (dealer hits/stands soft 17, DAS, surrender, 3:2 vs 6:5)
- **Card counting** requires **100% basic strategy** first [Source: WkGldDHLb5k]
- Common **EV leaks**: misplaying hard 15–16 vs 7–A, soft 18, failing to surrender [Source: LKV4yjnnpC0]
- Avoid side bets and carnival variants with large house edge [Source: en1TDlMoQzo]

**Casino bet ranking (American Casino Guide)**
- Best low-skill edges: **baccarat banker**, **craps pass + odds**, **full-pay video poker**, **blackjack with basic strategy** [Source: oupvsCHsjHs]
- VP paytable vigilance — small rule changes crush RTP (e.g. 96→85% example cited)

**Poker**
- **Math-first** edge (pot odds, equity) [Source: QqXzTxxMzjU]
- **Triple threat**: position + aggression + fundamentals; minimize mistakes [Source: zH45e91Nk8E]
- MTT beginner tips: stack preservation, blind structure awareness [Source: k0tKWIrHpMk]

**OddsJam AI sports (pgTc2OQN60U)**
- Experimenter tests **ChatGPT** for +EV sports betting advice
- Reinforces **positive EV**, **bankroll management**, **Kelly** mention, line shopping across books
- Mixed good/bad AI advice — **not a substitute** for OddsJam scanner or sharp-line math `[TENTATIVE]`

## Snippets

> "The average blackjack player will be playing with a 1 to 2% disadvantage, the perfect basic strategy player will be playing with about half of 1% disadvantage." [Source: HeVclniKpHs]

> "If you can't follow perfect basic strategy 100% of the time, card counting is useless." [Source: WkGldDHLb5k]

> "…causes so many players to throw away expected value at the tables don't play scared follow the math…" [Source: LKV4yjnnpC0]

> "…referred to as positive EV betting positive expected value betting… finding value in the market…" [Source: pgTc2OQN60U]

> "Bankroll management is non-negotiable… the Kelly…" [Source: pgTc2OQN60U]

> "Position is to poker what location is to real estate." [Source: zH45e91Nk8E]

## Dead Ends

- **Martingale / 31 / Fibonacci** (`RxEuPiI8fXI`) — does not change house edge; increases ruin risk `[RETRACTED]`
- **Slot picker systems** (`JK5-yun_7mo`, `vpmdkT1q5oo`) — no beatable RTP selection without insider PAR data `[RETRACTED]`
- **Vegas Matt / Brettski vlogs** — entertainment bankroll, not methodology
- **100k-bot casino sim** (`0ma6hXtzZDc`) — YouTube entertainment, not strategy
- **Online bot/collusion** (`CIYODgIqqhU`, Whale Slots podcasts) — fraud/rake environment risk, not edge
- **SirPugger** (`jWXfzrXV1bA`) — RuneScape gambling bots; out of wiki scope
- **Galfond 3h compilation** (`GE8BGWjUDYs`) — defer; link-only unless deep poker ingest requested
