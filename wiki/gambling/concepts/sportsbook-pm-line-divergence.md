## Relations

- @concepts/gambling-bot-architecture.md — divergence bot lane
- @concepts/line-shopping-and-clv.md — CLV on books; divergence is cross-venue CLV analog
- @entities/tools/momentum-odds.md — commercial multi-book + PM routing feed
- @concepts/world-cup-books-vs-pm-divergence.md — WC-specific nation-level gaps

## Raw Concept

When **FanDuel/DK/Pinnacle implied probability** differs materially from **Kalshi/Polymarket** on the same sporting outcome — and how retail bettors evaluate (not automate) the gap.

## Narrative

### Core idea (multi-source K80)

YouTube batch (Beast Sports, MomentumOdds/Odds channel): edge framed as **sportsbook consensus vs PM line** on totals and moneylines — not sub-second in-play scraping for most retail.

**Live caveat (Kalshi NBA, 2606.07811):** even when a static book-vs-PM gap exists, **live Kalshi mids lag** public-information fair value by ~36% on impact and drift over minutes — but spread/fees kill naive "chase the lag" execution. See `@concepts/pm-live-belief-updating.md`.

```
Sportsbook consensus (60+ books via MomentumOdds, or sharp close via Pinnacle)
        ↓ compare implied %
Kalshi / Polymarket contract mid
        ↓ if gap > fees + model uncertainty
Consider bet on cheaper venue (or pass)
```

### Structural vig gap (R2, 2026-06-01)

Even when **prices align**, books embed **~4.5% hold** in -110/-110 markets vs **sub-2% fee blends** on Kalshi for comparable event contracts [TENTATIVE — Tech-Insider]. Divergence shopping must subtract **fee + tax + limit risk** on each side.

### Workflow

1. Convert all prices to **implied probability**
2. Subtract **fees/hold** on each venue (`@concepts/vig-and-hold.md`, PM taker fees)
3. Confirm **same resolution** (regulation vs OT, push rules)
4. Size with fractional Kelly — `@concepts/kelly-criterion-betting.md`
5. Log result vs **closing** for skill tracking

### Fiat sharp/soft analog

Gemini landscape: Pinnacle moves first; soft books lag → short-window arb. PM×Kalshi behaves similarly — regulated vs crypto CLOB efficiency gradient `@concepts/sharp-vs-soft-books.md`.

### Failure modes

- **False equivalence** — PM "Team wins" vs book spread are not the same bet
- **Latency** — gap closes before manual execution
- **Marketing signals** — MomentumOdds/Odds Jam promos overstate hit rate; verify 3+ months
- **Geoblock / KYC** — cannot always execute on both legs

### World Cup extension
