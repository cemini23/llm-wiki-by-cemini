## Raw Concept

Foundational discipline page: how to partition capital, size bets/units, and survive variance across sports betting, casino, poker, and DFS.

## Narrative

### Separate bankrolls

Keep **distinct pools** for unrelated verticals (sports vs poker vs casino vs DFS). Mixing pools hides true ROI and encourages cross-subsidizing -EV play.

| Vertical | Typical rule of thumb | Notes |
|----------|----------------------|-------|
| Sports betting | 1–3% of bankroll per bet ("unit") | Scale down during losing streaks or model uncertainty |
| Poker (cash) | 20–40 buy-ins for stake level | Move down at 20 BI; move up at 40+ BI [TENTATIVE — standard poker literature] |
| Poker (MTT) | **100+ buy-ins** for stake | $100 → $1 MTTs; move to $2 at $200; step down at $100; don't move up on one score [Source: yrGExOmDRLk] |
| Casino (table games) | Session bankroll = acceptable loss | Never chase; pre-set stop-win/stop-loss |
| DFS (GPP) | 10–20% of weekly DFS bankroll per slate | Correlation across entries still counts as one slate exposure |

### Units vs dollars

Express edge bets in **units** (1u = 1% of current bankroll or fixed fraction). Recompute bankroll after each settled period (daily/weekly). Avoid "double up to recover" — martingale is `[RETRACTED]` for +EV play.

### Record-keeping

Track: date, sport/market, line, odds, stake, result, closing line (for CLV). Without logs, perceived skill dominates actual ROI.

**Strategy A/B monitoring (K148):** when comparing manual betting or pick'em processes over time, consider **anytime-valid stochastic dominance** e-processes on full P&L distributions (@sources/arxiv-2604.21851-betting-on-bets-stochastic-dominance-2026-07-06.md) — sequential monitoring only, not live bet triggers.

### Responsible gambling guardrails

- Wager only where legal for your jurisdiction
- Pre-commit loss limits; use sportsbook deposit limits when available
- Treat marketing bonuses as **+EV only after full TOS math** — `@entities/tools/odds-jam.md` + `@concepts/pm-copy-trading-retail-risks.md`
- **Poker MTT:** chasing stakes above BRM for a "quick score" is **gambling**, not grind [Source: yrGExOmDRLk]

### WagerBrain reference map (K92 steal-from — not a dependency)

`sedemmler/WagerBrain` (MIT, stale 2020) — use as **requirements vocabulary** for gambling-bot sizing modules; re-implement in fleet code, do not `pip install` unmaintained package.

| WagerBrain module | Fleet use |
|-------------------|-----------|
| `odds.py` | American / decimal / fractional conversion |
| `probs.py` | Implied probability ↔ odds |
| `payouts.py` | Profit, parlay payout, EV |
| `bankroll.py` | Kelly criterion, unit sizing caps |
| Phase 2 | Vig, arb detection — spec only until sportsbook API lane is licensed |
