## Raw Concept

Why **following whale wallets** or copy-alert products (Odds Jam Prediction Insiders, PolySniper-style promos) often underperforms marketing — retail discipline checklist.

## Narrative

### Structural problems

1. **Adverse selection** — you buy after smart money; slippage on thin books
2. **Cascade crowding** — open-source copy bots pile on same wallet trade in seconds [CONFIRMED Gemini landscape]
3. **Fee drag** — PM taker fees compound with high trade count
4. **Survivorship marketing** — products highlight top wallets, not full distribution
5. **Win rate ≠ ROI** — Financial Wolf: **54%** win rate, modest dollar profit vs variance
6. **Inferred flow direction ≈ noise** — K100 Polymarket-v1 panel: tick rule / bulk volume classifiers **~50%** accuracy vs on-chain ground truth; inferred VPIN/OFI diverge from true measures `[CONFIRMED — arXiv 2606.04217]`. Wallet-copy products that label "buy pressure" from public WebSocket without on-chain join inherit this error (`@sources/arxiv-polymarket-v1-database-2606.04217-2026-06-05.md`).

### Financial Wolf 30-day calibration ($1,000 start) [TENTATIVE]

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| PM P&L | ~$224 on ~$7.5k wagered |
| Win rate | 54% vs ~65% marketed |
| Bankroll end | ~$1,698 incl. **non-PM** casino bonus +EV |
| Takeaway | Possible small edge vs random; **underperforms** bold bot stats |

### Retail rules before subscribing

1. **3-month personal log** required — ignore 30-day promo windows
2. Cap trades/day — over-trading erodes edge (`@concepts/bankroll-management.md`)
3. Filter high-confidence only (experiment used >80 score later)
4. Never treat alerts as **insider trading** — public on-chain flow
5. Compare DIY wallet tracking latency vs product — `@osint-wiki` for technical path

### Open-source copy bots

Gemini landscape: **NO-GO** — strategy mismatch for retail; toxic flow amplifier. Document only in Dead Ends.
